# codetrans issue

reproducer project for a codetrans issue, when a string with \u-escaped values
is used the files generated by codetrans for js and groovy have the unquoted
representation of the string in the source. this may be permissible in
javascript and groovy, but it apparently confuses asciidoc and if a nul byte
is in the file git thinks its a binary file.

it would be better to have the json-encoded string in the source.

it looks like the chars that are not iso-8859-1 (0x80-0x9f) end up as ?
