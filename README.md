# docgen issue

reproducer project for a docgen issue, when a string with \u-escaped values is used
the files generated by docgen for js and groovy have the unquoted reprentation of the string in the source. this may be permissible in javascript and groovy, but it apparently confused asciidoc and if a nul byte is in the file git thinks its a binary file.

it would be better to have to json-encoded string in the source.

it looks like the chars that are not iso-8859-1 (0x80-0x9f) end up as ?
